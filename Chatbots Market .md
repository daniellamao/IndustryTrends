**Chatbots Market Size & Growth Trends, 2036**

The global [chatbot market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/chatbot-market/5567) is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased demand in consumer finance. The main purpose of chatbots, which use computer programs to mimic human responses, is to reduce the cost of hiring human customer service representatives. Financial institutions have recently begun experimenting with natural language processing, neural networks, and generative machine learning to automatically generate chat responses that can be spoken or written as text. Additionally, financial institutions are increasingly turning to chatbots as they offer a more cost-effective alternative to human customer support.
